      <p>
        A sexy mistake. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all,
        "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Why did
        you bring us here? Look, last night was a mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.
        <strong>
          Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death
          with his own Oscar.</strong

        <em> I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</em> This is the worst kind of
        discrimination: the kind against me!
      </p>
      <h2>Oh God, what have I done?</h2>
      <p>
        No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! I never
        loved you. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive
        decompression! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics
        lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they
        feel. That makes me feel angry!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Look, last night was a mistake.</li>
        <li>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</li>
        <li>Ummm…to eBay?</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</h3>
      <p>
        You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making
        you'll be doing. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics,
        then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Throw her in the brig.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little
          food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you
          sexually?
        </li>
        <li>And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</li>
        <li>Who are those horrible orange men?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive
        decompression! Look, last night was a mistake. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK
        THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he
        forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can explain. It's very valuable. Hello Morbo, how's the family? When
        the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two
        consenting adults. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. I barely knew Philip, but
        as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all
        about him. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours
        is small and neutral!
      </p>
      <p>
        Bender, we're trying our best. I wish! It's a nickel. Hello, little man.
        I will destroy you! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye,
        cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of
        cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel
        though they may be…
      </p>
      <p>
        You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Bender, quit destroying the universe!
        Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope
        hat." And "Put on your good vestments." And remember, don't do anything
        that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in
        which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!
      </p>
      <p>
        What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!
        Now what? Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Yeah. Give a little credit to our
        public schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I'm his friend Jesus. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all,
        "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Maybe I
        love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are the last hope of the universe. There's one way and only one way
        to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Why am I
        sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I suppose I could part with
        'one' and still be feared…
      </p>
      <p>
        Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? File
        not found. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Leela, Bender, we're
        going grave robbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust
        you? Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Now that the, uh, garbage
        ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual
        inhibitions?
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. We're also
        Santa Claus! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can
        see her spewers? Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Goodbye, friends. I never
        thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Who are those horrible orange
        men? Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER
        ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is
        intelligent. Dissect its brain! When will that be? We're also Santa
        Claus! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!
        <strong>
          Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to.</strong

        <em> $9.</em> 95 a minute.
      </p>
      <h2>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</h2>
      <p>
        Okay, I like a challenge. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't
        rock. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken
        away! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could
          just learn to play this stupid thing.
        </li>
        <li>You are the last hope of the universe.</li>
        <li>I just told you! You've killed me!</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Bender, quit destroying the universe!</h3>
      <p>
        Yeah, lots of people did. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly?
        …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you
        say. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's toe-tappingly tragic!</li>
        <li>I'm a thing.</li>
        <li>It must be wonderful.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two
        consenting adults. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so
        that I may blackmail them later. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a
        third time! But that would be it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kif might! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old
        enough to feel ways about stuff! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing:
        tedious. Say it in Russian! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this
        money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
      </p>
      <p>
        My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the
        Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of
        Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark
        wizards. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shut up and take my money! With a warning label this big, you know they
        gotta be fun! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause
        explosive decompression! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind
        Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help
        me with my sexual inhibitions? Now what? What are you hacking off? Is it
        my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! With gusto.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As
        though! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Oh, but you can. But you may
        have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I
        mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say what? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! This is
        the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Guess again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well,
        that's love for you. Is that a cooking show? What are their names? It
        doesn't look so shiny to me. Isn't it true that you have been paid for
        your testimony?
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Bender! Ship!
        Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions
        manually! Ooh, name it after me! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all
        are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five
        hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
      </p>
      <p>
        A true inspiration for the children. I just told you! You've killed me!
        I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known
        universe! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Really?! No, just a regular mistake. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is
        in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?
        Ask her how her day was. Negative, bossy meat creature!
